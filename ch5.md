                    dharmas always exist
                        do not move in/out of existence
                    shift from future to present to past
                    what is past and future depends on context

                - expanded role for the laity
            `bodhisattva`
                replaces ideal of arhant
                    arhants are not perfect like the buddha was
                    people want to be like the buddha ... better than arhant
                status of arhant goes down
                status of buddha goes up
                at one point the buddhas life was somewhat like mine
                    creates interest in the buddhas past lives

                mention of secret teachings
                    concept of `doctrinal widening`
                        buddhism allows for speculation on different beliefs since they are not crucial to appreciating the religion.

                    perfection of wisdom
                `lotus sutra`

            implies that other sects are `hinayana`
                small minded
                make up most of the buddhists

            oral exam for admission
            attracted students from all over the world
            monks lost touch with the outside world
            became concentrated at institutions for higher learning
                unlike hinduism
                    always had village roots
            muslim raids
                monestaries were undefended
